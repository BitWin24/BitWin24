[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BitWin24/bitwin24.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BitWin24/bitwin24) [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/BitWin24%2Fbitwin24.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/BitWin24%2Fbitwin24)

[BITWIN24](https://BitWin24.io) is an open source cryptocurrency for real-world use cases while providing truly decentralized solutions to our users. Bitwin24 is a Blockchain Lottery Coin (BWI) with Masternode service.

We also strongly believe that the incentivized two-tier model brought about by masternodes is the best way to create the commitment and retention needed for perennial growth. In addition to creating a robust and highly serviceable network, we see the masternode ecosystem as a means to long-term investment. For this purpose, we have developed a masternode with stable ROI independend to the number of masternodes. The constant ROI is limited to the number of the total supply and will change after a setted total supply will be reached, which can take few years.
